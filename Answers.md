1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Client-side loads the whole website on the first request which makes the initial load time slower. This means we don't need to wait for a response from a server or a refresh on each page change.

    Server-side will only request the data that is needed which means every new request will result in a new refresh but the initial load time is faster. However, it is slower when being routed between pages.
